# Eclipse Tools

[Eclipse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) is one of my favorite boardgames.  

This repository contains the beginnings of a website to provide helpful utilities for players.

## Faction Randomizer 

The only tool built so far is a faction randomizer - if one owns all the expansions there are 24 
different playable factions with no standardized way to select them at random.  The faction randomizer will allow you 
to specify which expansions you own, and how many "generic" (i.e. Terran, Magellan, or Octantis) factions you want included 
in the random pool, and ensure that no invalid combinations are generated.

### Planned additions

* Store your most recent settings in a cookie, so you are already set up for the next game.
* Allow manual entry of player names
* Better graphics with faction pictures

### Explanation for non-players: 
Each players uses a cardboard play mat showing their faction. The play mats are all
printed with an alien species on one side and a "generic" faction on the other side. In the base game, it's six
aliens with different abilities and six "Terrans".  The terrans are all identical except for color. Some players 
of the base game might want to randomly select between the six aliens and one terran, some might want to include zero 
terrans, or four, or whatever.
